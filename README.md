# 3D-Segmentation-Model-on-CT-Abdomen-Organs

## Overview

This project focuses on building a 3D segmentation model for abdominal organs, specifically targeting the Liver, Right Kidney, Left Kidney, and Spleen from CT scan images. The model was trained to accurately segment these organs using volumetric data in .nii format. The primary goal is to achieve high segmentation accuracy, measured by the Dice score.
